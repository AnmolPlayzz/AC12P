# Comment  Guidelines.

1. Keep it clean, but not too clean. A little fucking swearing is allowed, but don't go full potty-mouth on me.

2. Be nice, or at least pretend to be. No personal attacks, or general douchebaggery allowed.

3. Stay on topic, unless you're really fucking hilarious. Then I'll allow a little off-topic banter.

4. No spamming, I'll shove a banana up your ass if I find you spamming my database with bullshit.

5. Use your brain, even if it's the size of a pea. I will delete any comments (and individuals) that are just plain stupid.

6. No self promo, https://adsense.google.com/start/ way better.

7. No explicit content, otherwise I'll report you for terrorism to the government.
