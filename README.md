## Archival Notice

This website has been archived. Everything here is read only now.

Building this website has taught me a lot, about programming and about web design. So thank you to everyone who appreciated it! And even if you didn't like it, thanks for being a critic.

If you could take anything away from this, it's that dumb shit you make on a friday night can turn into something way cooler.
